# Gm4B dataset


This is labeled dataset for 3D building models extraction of geomeshes proposed by our paper [A Bidirectionally Greedy Framework for Unsupervised 3D Building Extraction from Airborne-based 3D Meshes](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2023.104917) that has been accepted to Automation in Constrution.
